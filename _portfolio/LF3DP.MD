# Features

* **Lightweight Triangular Structure** With its rigid 90° geometry and two large relief cut-outs, this bracket combines strength with reduced weight, making it ideal for motor or sensor mounts.
* **High-Strength Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum** CNC-machined from aerospace-grade aluminum, then anodized black for enhanced corrosion resistance and a professional finish.
* **Optimized for Standard Hardware** Pre-countersunk M5 holes allow screws to sit flush with the surface. The design fits common NEMA-17/NEMA-23 stepper motor hole patterns, ensuring easy integration.
